# Llama-Website
This is a website that I designed as a final project for a WD class at school. The topic could be anything we wanted, so naturally, I decided to make a satirical website about the wonders of llamas. With the project focusing on the actual execution of creating a site, I wanted to have some fun in the process. 

Some screenshots of the site are included below.
