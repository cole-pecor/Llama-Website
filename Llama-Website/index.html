			<h2 class="space">Welcome to Hey, Llamas Are Actually Pretty Dang Cool!</h2>
			<p>Thank you for visiting Hey Llamas Are Actually Pretty Dang Cool, or HLAAPDC for short. This website is dedicated to spreading awareness of the underrated blessings on human existance that are llamas!
			Whether you went looking for this site, stumbled upon it, or was forced by one of our *ahem* convincing marketing agents, we hope you can learn about llamas to your hearts content.</p>
			
			<h2>Why learn about llamas?</h2>
			<p>Throughout the crazy twists and turns in this thing we called life, we all need to find ways to let some more light into our lives. For many, the joy of learning about llamas is the sunlight
			from which they must move their blinds. Maslow was an intelligent guy, but he missed one thing: llamas are the key. As you learn more about these fuzzy, adorable wonders of nature you may feel like you are transcending - 
			this is natural. So we here at HLAAPDC implore you, open your blinds, and let in the glistening light that are llamas.</p>
