		<p class="subPara">Being gifted with many talents, the llama has the uncanny abiliity to wow each and every one of its 
		human companions with a useful and effective tree of skills used in their everyday lives. Whether dormant,
		 or still actively used, llamas are capable, living, breathing machines.</p>

				<h2>Packing</h2>
				<p>Llamas are fantastic animals to have around when you just don't feel like carrying that darn luggage. They can carry loads up to 75 pounds, and travel as far as 20 miles a day. (Plenty of distance to get you around the airport.<br><br>
				Llamas are smart too. They are aware of how much of a load they can take, and if they so feel, they will lay down and stubbornly sit until their load is lightened.</p>

				<h2>Guarding the Herd</h2>
				<p>Being naturally protective, Llamas make great guards for livestock. Llamas are social creatures, and will consider groups of sheep or goats to be a part of their own herd. They will fend off predators, protecting the group they're a part of.<br><br>
				Their intelligence also makes them much more capable guardians. They are able to tell the difference between threats- distinguishing "between the neighbor's dog and a predatory coyote" (oregonstate.edu) </p>

				<h2>Therapy and Health</h2>
				<p>Llamas have shown themselves to be quite helpful for human health. According to treehugger.com, they "have a soothing aura about them." Llamas can be trained as effective therapy animals, working wherever they are needed. <br><br>
				They also have promise to help progress an effective flu vaccine. Researchers have found that llamas contain antibodies that could be effective against many different strains of the flu, and have already developed a (currently unapproved) nasal spray using those antibodies.</p>
