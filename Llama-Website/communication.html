		<h1 class="center">Llama Communication</h1>
		<p class="subPara">Contrary to popular belief, llamas are fanastic communicators. With several different ways
		to connect with and talk to other llamas, relationships are made, love is kindled, and hearts are broken.
		Llamas express their emotion through these different amazing communication skills.</p>

				<h2>Humming</h2>
				<p>One of the most common forms of communication for the llama is humming. Mother llamas will hum to their offspring called crias. Over time, the crias learn to recognize their mother's voice. 
				This noise is also used to communicate a multitude of emotions. According to Treehugger.com, "they also make this noise when they're anxious, tired, uncomfortable, excited, or just curious."</p>

				<h2>Alarm Cry</h2>
				<p>Llamas are fantastic guards, and have a good sense of approaching danger. When they're scared, they will sometimes express this fear by using an alarm cry.</p>
				<p class="warning">Warning: The second cry in this video is <b>significantly</b> louder than the first. Be mindful of audio levels. <b>(Adjust your audio to 20% or below.)</b></p>

				<h2>Orgling</h2>
				<p>Another sound that llamas make is called an "Orgle". This is a sort of gurgling sound, but they only make this noise while they're mating. Since this is supposed to be a kid friendly site, we decided against displaying a video.</p>
				<p>If you feel the need to subject yourself to the sound of llamas mating, we have provided the option in an audio format.</p>
			</div>
				<audio controls>
					<source src="media/Orgle.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
					<source src="media/Orgle.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				</audio>

				<h2>Spitting</h2>
				<p>You may be thinking, "HLAAPDC, spitting isn't a form of communication!" And to that we ask you, if you offer someone a carrot and they spit in your face, do you think they wanted the carrot or not?</p>
				<p>Much like humans have the ability to give the bird, llamas can spit. They use this to show anger, assert dominance, or simply to demonstrate displeasure. This spit is also sometimes slightly green,
				because of the half digest food that rides along with the spit. An effective way of denying a carrot indeed.</p>
